# add a new line for each command that you want to run at the system startup
# for example if you need to run a python file located at:
# /home/dorna/Projects/python/test.py
#
# Then add a new line to this file and use the "&" symbol at the end to jump to the next program without waiting for its completion.
# python3 /home/dorna/Projects/python/test.py &
#
# Also by default, all the startup programs listed here will be executed 5 seconds after the system startup.
